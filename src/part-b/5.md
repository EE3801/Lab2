# Part 5

## 49.
Now that we have looked at all three data files, we will look at how to align the three time-series to each other.
Write a Python script that will create a figure with three subplots that contain 
  1. the x-position in Unity as a function of time; 
  2. the eye position x as a function of time, and 
  3. the broadband signal as a function of time. 

Remember to add the markers to each of the subplots like you did previously.

Now write a Python script that will align the three time series to each other, and create a new figure with three subplots that shows the aligned data. In order to perform the alignment, think about what is common in all three time series. Add code that will set the x-limits for all the subplots to be the same.
